# Innovatech Aether
This project was completed with my team in just 24 hours at the HackNJIT Hackathon. We built an AI chatbot using the OpenAI API that generated responses in a steampunk-themed style. The project was developed with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and completing it under tight time pressure made the experience especially rewarding.
